/**
 * Screen share for a C2C video call. There is no native screen-share path on the watch AV stack
 * (only GPro channels have one), so we substitute the outgoing video source: capture the screen with
 * MediaProjection and inject the frames through the very same sink the camera uses,
 * `GraphicRenderMgr.getInstance().sendCameraFrame(nv21, 17, w, h, …)` — proven to replace the remote
 * video (see the moving-bars prototype).
 *
 * Flow: long-press → [toggle] launches [ScreenSharePermissionActivity] for the MediaProjection
 * consent → [onConsent] starts [ScreenShareService] (a `mediaProjection` foreground service, required
 * on Android 14+) which mirrors the screen into an ImageReader, converts each RGBA frame to NV21 and
 * calls [feedFrame]. While sharing, the camera is closed via [CameraUtils]'s CloseCameraRunnable
 * (`cu.h`) — that only releases the hardware, it does NOT clear `setLocalHasVideo`, so the peer keeps
 * receiving our (now screen) video. Toggling off stops the service and reopens the camera.
